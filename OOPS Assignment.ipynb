    " In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating objects, encapsulating data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class, representing a real-world entity or concept with its own unique state and behavior."

    " The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "Encapsulation: This refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It hides the internal details of the object from the outside world and allows access only through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction allows the creation of simplified representations of real-world objects in the form of classes. It focuses on the essential characteristics of an object and ignores the non-essential details, making it easier to work with complex systems.\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (called a superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different data types, and it can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading."
